def call_chat_completion (topic="The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health", essay="Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, connecting us with friends, family, and the wider world. While these platforms offer numerous benefits, such as facilitating communication and access to information, their impact on mental health is a growing concern. Studies have shown a correlation between excessive social media use and increased levels of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. The constant comparison to others, the fear of missing out (FOMO), and the curated portrayals of seemingly perfect lives can contribute to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction. Additionally, cyberbullying and online harassment can have severe consequences for mental well-being. It is important to recognize these potential risks and develop healthy habits around social media use, such as setting limits on screen time, prioritizing real-life interactions, and seeking support if needed."):
